# Battleship
Rudimentary game of battleship between a player and computer on a 10x10 board. 
Each player has 5 ships to place, which take up 1 tile each. Guessing continues until 1 player/computer runs out of ships.
To start, run file in IDE and place ships on board. Computer will place ships (hidden of course) next. Good luck!
